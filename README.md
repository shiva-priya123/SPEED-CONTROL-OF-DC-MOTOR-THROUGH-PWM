# SPEED-CONTROL-OF-DC-MOTOR-THROUGH-PWM
The dc motor speed is controlled by using power electronic device which is the PWM technique. The speed pulse train will be based on required input speed. This circuit is useful to operate the dc motors at required speed with very low losses and low cost. The circuit response time is fast. Hence high reliability can be achieved. The designed circuit was tested for various speed inputs satisfactorily. The method already employed in traction system and has a good scope ahead.
